# Guidance

**Purpose** Use this template to thoroughly evaluate code implementations after
they pass testing. Focus on **adherence** to the specification, code quality,
maintainability, security, performance, and consistency with the project style.

**When to Use**

- After the Tester confirms all tests pass.
- Before merging to the main branch or final integration.

**Best Practices**

- Provide clear, constructive feedback with examples.
- Separate issues by severity (critical vs. minor).
- Commend positive aspects too, fostering a healthy code culture.

## 2. Review Summary

### 2.1 Overall Assessment

| Aspect                      | Rating   | Notes                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Specification Adherence** | ⚠️ (TBE) | Cannot fully assess due to test failures.                                                  |
| **Code Quality**            | ⚠️ (TBE) | Cannot fully assess due to test failures. Linting reported as passed by implementer.       |
| **Test Coverage**           | ⭐       | **CRITICAL: 25% reported by CI. Required: ≥80%. Tests are failing due to an ImportError.** |
| **Security**                | ⚠️ (TBE) | Token limiting feature needs verification once tests pass.                                 |
| **Performance**             | ⚠️ (TBE) | Cannot assess.                                                                             |
| **Documentation**           | ⚠️ (TBE) | Code comments and docstrings to be reviewed once tests pass.                               |

_(TBE = To Be Evaluated)_

### 2.2 Key Strengths

- (To be evaluated once tests pass and coverage is adequate)

### 2.3 Key Concerns

- **CRITICAL: Test Failure:** An `ImportError` in
  [`tests/unit/test_schema_utils.py`](tests/unit/test_schema_utils.py:7)
  prevents the test suite from completing.
- **CRITICAL: Low Test Coverage:** Current coverage is 25%, far below the 80%
  minimum. Key new/refactored modules have very low coverage:
  - [`src/lionfuncs/network/endpoint.py`](src/lionfuncs/network/endpoint.py):
    26%
  - [`src/lionfuncs/network/executor.py`](src/lionfuncs/network/executor.py):
    24%
  - [`src/lionfuncs/network/imodel.py`](src/lionfuncs/network/imodel.py): 16%
  - [`src/lionfuncs/schema_utils.py`](src/lionfuncs/schema_utils.py): 16%
- Inability to verify PR objectives due to test issues.

### 4.4 Type Safety

(To be evaluated)

## 5. Test Coverage Analysis

### 5.1 Unit Test Coverage

| Module                                                                   | Coverage | Notes                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`src/lionfuncs/network/endpoint.py`](src/lionfuncs/network/endpoint.py) | 26%      | Critical new component with insufficient test coverage  |
| [`src/lionfuncs/network/executor.py`](src/lionfuncs/network/executor.py) | 24%      | Modified component with token limiting feature untested |
| [`src/lionfuncs/network/imodel.py`](src/lionfuncs/network/imodel.py)     | 16%      | Core component with generic invoke method untested      |
| [`src/lionfuncs/schema_utils.py`](src/lionfuncs/schema_utils.py)         | 16%      | Support module with potential import error              |

### 5.2 Integration Test Coverage

(Cannot be evaluated due to test failures)

### 5.3 Test Quality Assessment

**Critical Issues:**

- **ImportError in
  [`tests/unit/test_schema_utils.py`](tests/unit/test_schema_utils.py:7)**:
  Cannot import `pydantic_model_to_schema` from `lionfuncs.schema_utils`
- **Insufficient Coverage**: Overall coverage is 25%, far below the 80%
  requirement
- **Untested Core Functionality**: The new `Endpoint` class, generic `invoke`
  method, and token limiting features are largely untested

## 9. Recommendations Summary

### 9.1 Critical Fixes (Must Address)

1. Fix the ImportError in
   [`tests/unit/test_schema_utils.py`](tests/unit/test_schema_utils.py:7)
   related to missing `pydantic_model_to_schema` function
2. Significantly improve test coverage for the network module, particularly for:
   - `Endpoint` class in
     [`src/lionfuncs/network/endpoint.py`](src/lionfuncs/network/endpoint.py)
   - Token limiting in
     [`src/lionfuncs/network/executor.py`](src/lionfuncs/network/executor.py)
   - Generic `invoke` method in
     [`src/lionfuncs/network/imodel.py`](src/lionfuncs/network/imodel.py)
3. Ensure overall test coverage meets or exceeds the 80% requirement

### 9.2 Important Improvements (Should Address)

1. Improve documentation for the new `Endpoint` class and its integration with
   `iModel`
2. Add more integration tests between the connected components

### 9.3 Minor Suggestions (Nice to Have)

1. Enhance logging for API token limiting feature
2. Add more examples to docstrings

## 10. Conclusion

The PR cannot be approved in its current state due to failing tests and
insufficient test coverage. The ImportError in
[`tests/unit/test_schema_utils.py`](tests/unit/test_schema_utils.py) must be
resolved, and test coverage must be improved significantly to meet the 80%
requirement. Once these issues are addressed, a more thorough review of the
implementation details can be conducted.

**Decision: REQUEST_CHANGES**

The current implementation does not meet khive quality standards due to failing
tests and insufficient test coverage. Please address the issues outlined in
section 9.1 Critical Fixes before requesting another review.
